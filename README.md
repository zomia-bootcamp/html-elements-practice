# HTML5 Sectioning Elements

## Objective 
Gain a practical understanding of HTML5 sectioning elements and their usage in creating well-structured web pages.

## Instructions:

1. Fork and clone this repo to your local machine.


3. Read the article titled "Use HTML5 Sectioning Elements" available at the following [link](https://blog.teamtreehouse.com/use-html5-sectioning-elements).

2. Familiarize yourself with the concept and purpose of HTML5 sectioning elements, such as `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<article>`, `<section>`, `<aside>`, and `<footer>`. Understand how they contribute to creating a logical structure within web pages.

3. Inside the "index.html" file, you will find the basic structure of an HTML document including all appropriate tags (`<!DOCTYPE html>`, `<html>`, `<head>`, `<title>`, and `<body>`).

4. Create a `<header>` element and add a relevant heading or a logo inside it to represent the header section of your web page.

5. Next, implement a `<nav>` element within the body of the document. Populate it with a few anchor tags (`<a>`) to create a navigation menu. Link these anchors to different sections of your page using the appropriate `href` attribute values.

6. Create an `<article>` element and add some meaningful content to it. This content can be in the form of paragraphs, headings, images, or lists. Ensure that the content is related and forms a coherent article.

7. Use one or more `<section>` elements to divide the article content into logical sections. Each section should have a descriptive heading using the appropriate heading element (`<h1>`, `<h2>`, etc.).

8. Implement an `<aside>` element within the `<article>` element. Add supplementary content, such as related links, advertisements, or author information, to the aside section.

9.  Finally, create a `<footer>` element at the bottom of the page. Add relevant information like copyright notice, contact details, or social media links within this section.

10. Save the HTML file and open it in a web browser to view the rendered web page.

11. Verify that your page structure follows the principles discussed in the article, using appropriate sectioning elements to create a well-organized and semantically meaningful web page.

12. Bonus: Enhance the styling of your web page using html attributes to make it visually appealing. Experiment with different colors, fonts, margins, and padding to customize the appearance of your sections.

13. Optional: Share your completed "sectioning_elements.html" file with your instructor or peers for feedback and further discussion.

Note: While completing this task, feel free to refer to the article whenever necessary and explore additional resources to deepen your understanding of HTML5 sectioning elements.
